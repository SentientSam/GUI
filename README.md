# GUI
Tester files I am using to experiment with GUi and start developing

Graphical User Interfaces have become an interest of mine and I am hoping to experiment with them further and get to the point where I am comfortable developing.

The files here will be good introductory files. As I learn, I am going to comment these files and update them.

GUI.py is an intro file, showing frames, packing, buttons, and labels

GUI2.py is similar to GUI, however it shows some functionality of pack and further customizations

GUI3_Grid.py is where I started integrating the topic into the name (finally). It shows how to utilize grids, which are often superior to simply packing something into the window. Also shows a cool Checkbutton functionality.

GUI4_Function.py shows how to bind functions with widgets. Essentially this allows for buttins, etc. to actually perform an action. This file shows 2 methods of binding: The command parameter, and the bind function.

GUI5_Classes.py shows how classes are used with tkinter and also gives some insight into the exit button functionality and the init command function

GUI6_Menu.py is a menu file showing how to create and use a drop down menu. It does not go far into the uses of this but simply sshows the basics of "how to"
